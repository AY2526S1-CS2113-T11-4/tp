## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### List All Treatments feature

#### Design

The diagram below shows how the `ListAllTreatmentsCommand` class interacts with other components in the system.

![ListALlTreatmentsCommand class diagram](./images/ListAllTreatmentsCommand_Class_Diagram.png)

The design follows a command-based architecture, where each command is encapsulated in its own class
implementing the `Command` interface.\
`ListAllTreatmentsCommand` depends on the PetList object, which stores all registered pets. Each `Pet`
object maintains a list of `Treatment` objects.

When executed, the command iterates through each `Pet` in the `PetList`, retrieves its treatments,
and formats them into displayable strings. The command then sorts all treatments by their dates in
ascending order before printing them to the console.

### List Pet Treatments feature

#### Design

The figure below shows how the `ListPetTreatmentsCommand` interacts with other key classes in the system.
![ListPetTreatmentsCommand class diagram](./images/ListPetTreatmentsCommand_Class_Diagram.png)

The `ListPetTreatmentsCommand` follows a command-based architecture, where each command is encapsulated
in its own class implementing the `Command` interface.

When the command is executed:

1. user input is parsed to extract the petâ€™s name (n/PET_NAME)
2. command retrieves the corresponding Pet object from the PetList using getPetByName().
3. then obtains the list of treatments from the Pet object via getTreatments().
4. displays the list of treatments in a numbered format. If the pet has no logged treatments, 
   or if the pet is not found, the command prints a message.
