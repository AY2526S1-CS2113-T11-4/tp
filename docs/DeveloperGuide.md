## Design & implementation

### Feature: Add Pet
{add details here}

### Feature: Delete Pet
This feature is built using the Command Pattern. This design decouples the invoker 
(main app logic) from the operation itself by using a Command interface. 
The DeletePetCommand is a concrete implementation of this interface that contains 
all the logic for parsing and execution.

![DeletePetCommand Class Diagram](diagrams/DeletePetCommand_Class_Diagram.png)

As shown in the class diagram above, the DeletePetCommand does not manage the list directly. 
Instead, it holds a reference to a PetList instance (a "has-a" relationship, 
or Aggregation) that is provided to its constructor. This use of Dependency 
Injection makes the command highly testable, as the PetList can be easily mocked.

The execution flow starts when the exec method is called with the user's input. 
The command parses the string to find the pet's name, then validates the input by 
querying the PetList. If the syntax is correct and the pet exists, the 
command instructs the PetList to perform the actual deletion. The DeletePetCommand 
is also responsible for printing all relevant success or error messages to the user.

The detailed interaction between the main app (CuddleCare), DeletePetCommand, and 
PetList during execution is illustrated in the sequence diagram below.

### Feature: List All Treatments across all pets
#### Design

The diagram below shows how the `ListAllTreatmentsCommand` class interacts with other components in the system.

![ListALlTreatmentsCommand class diagram](diagrams/ListAllTreatmentsCommand_Class_Diagram.png)

The design follows a command-based architecture, where each command is encapsulated in its own class
implementing the `Command` interface.\
`ListAllTreatmentsCommand` depends on the PetList object, which stores all registered pets. Each `Pet`
object maintains a list of `Treatment` objects.

When executed, the command iterates through each `Pet` in the `PetList`, retrieves its treatments,
and formats them into displayable strings. The command then sorts all treatments by their dates in
ascending order before printing them to the console.

### Feature: List All Treatments of a pet
#### Design

The figure below shows how the `ListPetTreatmentsCommand` interacts with other key classes in the system.
![ListPetTreatmentsCommand class diagram](diagrams/ListPetTreatmentsCommand_Class_Diagram.png)

The `ListPetTreatmentsCommand` follows a command-based architecture, where each command is encapsulated
in its own class implementing the `Command` interface.

When the command is executed:

1. user input is parsed to extract the petâ€™s name (n/PET_NAME)
2. command retrieves the corresponding Pet object from the PetList using getPetByName().
3. then obtains the list of treatments from the Pet object via getTreatments().
4. displays the list of treatments in a numbered format. If the pet has no logged treatments,
   or if the pet is not found, the command prints a message.
