* Have a **scheduled date before today**.

If no pets have overdue treatments, a message confirming that is displayed.


**Examples**

    > overdue-treatments

**Notes**
* A treatment is **overdue** only if:
    - It is **not completed** (`isCompleted = false`)
    - Its **date is before today** (`t.getDate().isBefore(LocalDate.now())`)
* The command automatically calculates how many days each treatment is overdue.
* Works for either:
    - **All pets** (`overdue-treatments`)
    - **A specific pet** (`overdue-treatments n/<pet name>`)
* Displays friendly messages when:
    - No pets exist in the system

## FAQ
**Q**: What is the format for the dates?  
**A**: All commands which require date use this format: `YYYY-MM-DD`, example: `2025-10-31`

**Q**: Do I have to write tags in the same order as mentioned in the command syntax?  
**A**: No. Tags can be used in any order.  Example: `add-pet n/Milo s/Cat a/2` and `add-pet s/Cat a/2 n/Milo` both work the same.

**Q**: Are pet names case-sensitive?  
**A**: No. `milo` and `Milo` refer to the same pet.

**Q**: Can I add two pets with the same name?  
**A**: No. Each pet name must be unique.

**Q**: What does [X] mean beside a treatment?
**A**: [X] means the treatment is completed.
[ ] means it is pending.

**Q**: Will my data be saved automatically?
**A**: Yes. All valid commands are saved immediately, even before exiting.

**Q**: How do I clear all data at once without deleting one by one?  
**A**: Head over to `/data/` and delete the `cuddlecare_save.txt` file.  
> [!CAUTION]
> Deleting the save file permanently erase all application data.
